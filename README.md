# TurtleBot3
ROS exam project


Once you have downloaded the zip folder, you should extract the file in your "Home". 

You have to change the execution permission for the files ".sh" (go to the Home folder, open terminal and type: "chmod +x *.sh". 

There is also a folder called scripts (I have used Python3 but you can remove the 3 from the first row to use it with Python 2.x) you should repeat the same procedure for the python code.

I suggest to execute first the create_ws.sh. 


Note that I'm assuming you have already installed all the dependancies.

Here some reference:

Be sure to use the correct distribution I have used Melodic with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

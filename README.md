Once you have downloaded the zip folder, you should extract the file in your "Home". 

You have to change the execution permission for the files ".sh" (go to the Home folder, open terminal and type: "chmod +x *.sh". (*)

There is also a folder called scripts you should  repeat the same procedure for the python code.

I suggest to execute first the create_ws.sh. 


Note that I'm assuming you have already installed all the dependancies.
